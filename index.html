<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->
